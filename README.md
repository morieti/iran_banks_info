Built with :heart: for Persian developers ;)

It's been a hard time for me to find and list all Iran banks logos, IBAN codes and valid card numbers. So I decided to put them together in this package.

If you need to check users IBAN (sheba) Code or card number and find out which bank is his/her account, this is what you need.

You can use global `\Morieti\IranBanksInfo\Config` class to change some configs:

####standardCardNumberSize:
To change standard size of banks card numbers which is 16 by default.

####standardIbanSize:
To change standard size of iban code which is 26 by default. If you don't store 'IR' from beginning of the code, you can set this property to 24.

####baseImagePath:
By default, package will publish banks logos to `public/iran_banks_images` relative to your project's root. You may relocate the pictures, but remember to set the relative path to them by changing this property.

###<b><i>Config class uses the singleton pattern, so you may call it once and for all.</i></b>
